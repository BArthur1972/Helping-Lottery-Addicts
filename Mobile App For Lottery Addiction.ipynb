    "Lottery Addiction is a problem we all know too well. Although it starts out as a fun activity, it mostly turns out to become a habit and inevitably ends in an addiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like sports betting addicts among others, spending loans and savings is common to lottery addicts. This leaves them in debts and leads them to borrow or even steal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they first need to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to zero in on the 6/49 lottery and develop functions that wil help users answer these kind of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that I will win the big prize with just one ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability that I will win the big prize if I play multiple tickets?\n",
    "* What is the probability that I will have at least five winning numbers on just one winning ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, I will consider historical data from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. This data set is available on Kaggle and contains data for 3,665 drawings made between 1982 and 2018."

    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I began this project with the goal to write the logic for an app that provides lottery addicts with better estimates of their chances of winning the lottery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I developed the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* one_ticket_probability() — calculates the probability of winning the lottery with only one ticket.\n",
    "* check_historical_occurrence() — checks if a particular combination occurred in the Canada lottery data set.\n",
    "* multi_ticket_probability() — calculates the probability of winning the lottery with any number of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816.\n",
    "* probability_less_6() — calculates the probability of having exactly two, three, four or five winning numbers to win smaller prizes.\n",
    "* probability_at_least() - calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers to win smaller prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the questions we started with and the answers we got:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that I will win the big prize with just one ticket?\n",
    " - From the analysis, you are over 400,000 times more likely to become wealthy from making investments or running a business than you are to winning the lottery with a single ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that I will win the big prize if I play multiple tickets?\n",
    " - The more tickets you have, the higher your chances of winning the lottery,but the chance only increases largely with a significant amount of tickets; which will cost you a lot of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given that a combination costs $3:\n",
    " - 3 million dollars worth of tickets will only give you a 7.2 % chance.\n",
    " - You will need about 20 million dollars worth of tickets to get a 50% chance at winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that I will win smaller prizes?\n",
    " - The probability of winning smaller prizes is relatively higher with a smaller number of expected winning numbers. You have a better chance of getting exactly 2 winning numbers (13.238%) than getting exactly 5 winning numbers (0.002%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that I will have at least five winning numbers on just one winning ticket?\n",
    " - You have 1 in 53,992 chances of having at least 5 winning numbers on a ticket. This means you are 5 times more likely to win an Oscar award than you are to have at least 5 winning numbers on a 6/49 lottery ticket. So, probably enrolling in acting classes may be a better investment than buying lottery tickets.\n",
